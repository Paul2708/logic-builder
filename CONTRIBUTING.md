# Contributing guidelines
1. Please create a feature branch for your contribution. (E.g. `feature/finish-docs` or `feature/fix-recursion`)
2. Please create a pull request for the `develop` branch, NOT `master`.
3. If you're working on an issue please indicate that by commenting on said issue.
4. Please get in touch with me before making major changes.

Side note: Issues with the label `up for grabs` can be worked on without needing to contact me first (as long as you're not making any major changes).

Thank you!
